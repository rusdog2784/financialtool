# financialtool

Run "python tool.py" to start main program.

Input a ticker symbol (i.e.: AAPL, SUV, etc.) and the program will collect and 
calculate the financial ratios for that specified company and its competitors.

After program is finished running, open "out.csv" to view a table comparing the
multiple company's ratios.
